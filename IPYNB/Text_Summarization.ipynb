In this case, the end result\n","is still in the form of some document, but with a few sentences based on the length we\n","might want the summary to be. This is similar to an abstract or an executive summary\n","in a research paper. The main objective of automated document summarization is\n","to perform this summarization without involving human input, except for running\n","computer programs. Mathematical and statistical models help in building and\n","automating the task of summarizing documents by observing their content and context.\n","\n","There are two broad approaches to document summarization using automated\n","techniques. They are described as follows:\n","- __Extraction-based techniques:__ These methods use mathematical\n","and statistical concepts like SVD to extract some key subset of the\n","content from the original document such that this subset of content\n","contains the core information and acts as the focal point of the entire\n","document. This content can be words, phrases, or even sentences.\n","The end result from this approach is a short executive summary of a\n","couple of lines extracted from the original document. No new content\n","is generated in this technique, hence the name extraction-based.\n","- __Abstraction-based techniques:__ These methods are more complex\n","and sophisticated. They leverage language semantics to create\n","representations and use natural language generation (NLG)\n","techniques where the machine uses knowledge bases and semantic\n","representations to generate text on its own and create summaries\n","just like a human would write them. Thanks to deep learning, we can\n","implement these techniques easily but they require a lot of data and\n","compute.\n","\n","We will cover extraction based methods here due to constraints of needed a lot of data + compute for abstraction based methods.
